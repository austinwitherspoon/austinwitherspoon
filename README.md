## Hello!
My name is Austin, and I'm a software developer in the film industry.

# Programming
I've been programming since I was around 10 years old (back then, using Macromedia Flash to make video games!). Later I used Java to write Minecraft server plugins, including some games that were played by tens of thousands of people.

Nowadays I mostly work in Python, Rust, and Typescript.

# Education
I went to film school at the Academy of Film, Theatre, and Television in Sydney, Australia.

# Personal
I write music, run long distances, and watch movies in my free time.
