## Hello!
My name is Austin. I'm a software developer in the film industry.

# Programming
I've been programming since I was around 10 years old (back then, using Macromedia Flash to make little video games!). Later in High School I was using Java to write Minecraft server plugins, including some games that were played by tens of thousands of people.

Nowadays I mostly work in Python, Rust, and Typescript. When forced I may write C++ when experimenting with Unreal Engine games.

# Education
I went to film school at the Academy of Film, Theatre, and Television in Sydney, Australia! 

# Personal
I write music, love running, and writing scripts for movies I may or may not ever actually film.
